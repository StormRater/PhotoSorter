# PhotoSorter

This project is to create a program that will easily help me (and maybe others) sort my massive image library.

So far it uses Qt5.5 and is compiled/run on my x64 Windows 8.1 computer. I aim to make it 
compatible with x86 (if I hadn't fudged the Qt project creator settings) computers running Windows or Linux. Sorry Apple,
I don't want to mess with iPhoto.
